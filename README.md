Make sure that you download the images folder and put it in the same directory as MergeTree.py

My attempt to clarify how to use the files:
Please double check this.

To import data from MapConstruction:
    download the data files
    run converting_input.py, editing the athens files with the ones you want to use.

(In the future we may be able to input data from other sources)

You may also hard-code a graph at the bottom of the codes listing the position of each vertex under pos_dict, the edges shortly above, and the vertices as nodes.

To find the merge tree of a graph, use MergeTree.py.

To draw a graph use Drawing.py.

To find a distance between two merge trees, use Interleaving.py.

Ignore .gitignore.

Open Animated_Merge.gif for cool effects.

Have a nice day!
